### Preprocessing  
Tissue region segmentation (Otsuâ€™s method of foreground segmentation)
* Randomly extract patches (256 x 256) on the tissue region
    - Tumor slide : 1K positive and 1K negative from each slide 
    - Normal slide: 1K negative from each slide 
    - ~290K training patches
    - Make predictions and construct heatmaps 
    - Extract additional ~60K training patches from false positive regions  
    - 290K + 60K = 350K training patches in total  
    
### DATA AUGMENTATION
* Randomly crop a 224 x 224 sub-region and flip patches  horizontally  
### Train Network
